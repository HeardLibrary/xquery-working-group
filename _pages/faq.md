## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why XQuery for TEI?

If you're working with any kind of structured data—like, for instance, the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)—you will benefit from learning XQuery. Check out the [multiple grant-funded XQuery projects in the Digital Humanities](http://searchvu.vanderbilt.edu/search?q=xquery+OR+gazeteer+OR+GeoPACHA&btnG=Search&client=publications&output=xml_no_dtd&proxystylesheet=publications&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF-8&getfields=*&num=10&lr=&sort=date%3AD%3AL%3Ad1&entsp=a__2012news_biasing&wc=200&wc_mc=1&ud=1&numgm=15&exclude_apps=1&site=publications&tlen=300&getfields=*&numgm=15&filter=0) at Vanderbilt.

### What if I'm new to programming?

We strive to make our sessions accessible to non-programmers, including complete beginners. We always start each meeting with review of a basic topic and encourage newcomers to pair with more experienced participants.

### Can I join anytime?

Yes! We try to keep our sessions as modular as possible. If you need help with anything we've covered in a previous session, we'd be glad to bring you up to speed. We strive to be a friendly and welcoming group at all times.
